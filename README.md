# Curriculum-Vitae
The final user who will be searching for this type of curriculum will be looking for a journalist or writer, a person with the abilities to describe, analyze and condense a lot of information in a more easily way. 

The architecture I used for this project consists of four grids, each one with important information about the person. The first one has a little of information, a photo, his name, the place where he lives and his contact mail. The next one, on the right side and the one that takes more space, is about past jobs, work experience. 
Under the first grid, we find one square about the studies, where he studied, what he studied and what can he make.
The last information, situated int the right below, we have his skills, characteristics that canâ€™t be in another section. Abilities that he have and can be important 
This section is divided in four, two squares about experiences and studies are in one color, in gray, and the other two, more personal, are in another color, a darker gray.  
For the majority of the text, I used inter medium in a size or twenty or twenty-five and for the titles I used in size forty with underline with in some cases with dark border.
